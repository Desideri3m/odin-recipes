# odin-recipes

This is my first project from The Odin Project. The goal of this project is to build a basic recipe website using only HTML.

## Skills Demonstrated
- Basic HTML structure
- Using headings, paragraphs, links, and images
- Creating multiple pages and linking them together
- Using Git and GitHub for version control

## Project Description
This website contains a main index page that links to several recipe pages. Each recipe page includes a title, image, description, ingredients list, and cooking steps.

## What I Learned
- How to structure a simple website with HTML
- How to use Git to track changes
- How to push projects to GitHub using WSL
